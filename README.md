# CDRec Python Implementation

Python implementation of CDRec (Centroid Decomposition Recovery) algorithm proposed in the paper *Scalable recovery of missing blocks in time series with high and low cross-correlations*.

This is a recovery method for univariate time series exhibiting variations in correlations.
It is a matrix-based algorithm that relies on the **Centroid Decomposition**.
To make it scalable, it includes the *Incremental Scalable Sign Vector* (ISSV) algorithm.
